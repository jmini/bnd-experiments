== Dolor bundles

The dolor bundles are similar to the link:../ipsum-bundle/[Ipsum Bundle] but separated into multiple bundles:

* `dolor-api-bundle`
* `dolor-bundle`
* `dolor-test`

Having the api in a separated bundle allows to call a service from the code that starts the OSGi runtime.
This uses the `org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra` configuration when the OSGi runtime is started.

The test bundle contains the tests that needs to be executed inside an OSGi context.
The JUnit 5 Extensions from link:https://github.com/osgi/osgi-test[OSGi Testing Support] project are used to write them.
Check for example the `@ExtendWith(..)` annotation at the top of the test classes.
