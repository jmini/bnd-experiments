== Effective OSGi Example

This projects shows how an Equinox based application can be built using a maven-only approach (without tycho).

This is based on the https://github.com/effectiveosgi/maven-archetypes[effective-osgi maven archetypes].

This project is the result of the execution of following archetypes:

* `eosgi-project-archetype:0.0.5`
* `eosgi-module-archetype:0.0.5`
* `eosgi-test-module-archetype:0.0.5`

With some additional changes (to use Equinox instead of Felix) and cleanups.
