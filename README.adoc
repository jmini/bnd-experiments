== Description

This repository contains several projects that are my experiments with link:https://bnd.bndtools.org/[Bnd] and with other projects using those tools.

* Run the link:run-bnd-cli-with-jbang/[bnd cli with Jbang]
* Experiments with the link:https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/biz.aQute.bnd.gradle/README.md[Bnd Gradle Plugin] used in non-Bnd Workspace Builds.
** link:lorem-bundle/[Lorem bundle] a simple bundle
** link:ipsum-bundle/[Ipsum bundle] a bundle that uses annotations (`@Component`, `@Export`)
** link:dolor/[Dolor bundles] different bundles to split api, implementation and test.
* Effective OSGi Example: projects inside link:effectiveosgi-example/[effectiveosgi-example] folder were created using sevreal archetypes.
* Issue with Groovy `3.0.0` (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9402[GROOVY-9402])
** Project link:groovy-v3-xml-test/[groovy-v3-xml-test] shows an issue with the OSGi metadata with Groovy `3.0.0`.
